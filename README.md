# XenevaOS Source Reference

Automatically generated source-level reference and call/include graphs for the XenevaOS.

This is an automatically generated, source-level reference for the XenevaOS operating system codebase. It provides indexed access to source files, functions, macros, and data structures, together with include graphs and call/caller graphs generated directly from the source code. It is designed to support large-scale code navigation, architecture exploration, and debugging workflows for developers working on XenevaOS.

This reference is intended primarily for operating system and low-level systems developers. It assumes familiarity with kernel-level programming, system architecture, and C/C++ codebases, and is not intended as end-user documentation.

## Key benefits

- **Faster debugging** — Quickly identify callers and call paths for kernel and driver functions
- **Rapid cross-file navigation** — Move across kernel, drivers, boot, and architecture-specific code
- **Easier analysis** — Inspect include relationships and layering boundaries
- **Improved onboarding** — Searchable symbol references for new contributors

This repository does not contain authored documentation. All pages are generated automatically from the upstream XenevaOS source tree using Doxygen and Graphviz.

The reference is rebuilt automatically on every update and on a nightly schedule through GitHub Actions.
